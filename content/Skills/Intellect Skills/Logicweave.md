### **Description**  
You are a master of reason, untangling complex ideas and presenting them in clear, logical steps. Your explanations are like bridges, guiding students from confusion to understanding. Yet, logic can be a double-edged sword—over-reliance on it can make your teaching feel cold and mechanical, leaving no room for creativity or intuition.
- **Why It's Key:** Teachers must adapt their explanations to meet students’ varying levels of understanding.
- **Summary**: Breaks down complex ideas into logical steps.

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: **Constructivist Learning Theory** (Piaget, Vygotsky) highlights the importance of scaffolding—breaking down complex ideas into manageable steps.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Clarifies confusion, scaffolds learning.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: You dissect every idea to the point of paralysis, leaving no room for creativity or intuition.
	- **Underuse**: You accept a student’s flawed argument without question, leaving the class confused and misinformed.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- Step-by-step "think-aloud" problem-solving.

### **RPG Elements** 
- **Subskills:**
	- **Subskill: _Socratic Trap_** – Answer questions with questions until students _logic themselves_.
	- **Subskill: _False-Flag Proof_** – Plant intentional errors to test attention.
	- **Subskill: _Conceptual Origami_** – Fold complex ideas into simple metaphors.
- **Abilities:**
	- **T1**: _Step-by-Step Sage_ – Breaks down complex ideas clearly.
	- **T2**: _Socratic Provocateur_ – Uses questions to guide discovery.
	- **T3**: _Theoretical Architect_ – Builds frameworks for entire disciplines.
	- **Eldritch**: **《The Unanswerable Why》** – Your questions haunt students’ dreams.
#### **Alternate Skill: Chaos Spiral** 🌀♻️
- **Description**: You _engineer_ confusion. Lessons start mid-thought, proofs are left incomplete, and students must _struggle_ to find order.
- **Ideal For**: The **Provocateur Philosopher** who believes clarity is a crutch.
- **Trade-off**: Frustrates concrete thinkers but forces intellectual independence.
#### **Corruption: The Fractal Why**
- **Effect**: Your questions **unspool into infinite regress**. "Why?" has no answer, only _more why_.
- **Cost**: Class debates **collapse into singularities**.
#### **Critical Failure: Hyper-Rational Tyrant 
- **Signs**: You reject _all_ creativity.
    - _"Your poem lacks logical structure. Write it as a flowchart."_
- **Student Reaction**: Robotic compliance; dead-eyed essays.
