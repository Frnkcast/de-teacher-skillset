### **Description**  
You’re a shark—stop moving, and you die. Conferences, webinars, obscure JSTOR deep dives—you _feed_. But knowledge isn’t just hoarding; it’s sharing. And if you’re always learning, when do you _teach_?
- **Why It's Key:** Models intellectual curiosity for students.
- **Summary:** Continuously deepen subject mastery beyond requirements.

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: 
	- **Andragogy** (Knowles, 1980): Adult learning principles.
	- **Communities of Practice** (Wenger, 1998): Collaborative learning.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Stays relevant, inspires passion.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Takes 17 online courses—forgets to teach.
		- You’re a course-hopping phantom, never settling long enough to impact your students.
	- **Underuse**: Still uses overhead transparencies ‘for nostalgia’.
		- Your lesson plans fossilize. Your students yawn. The future leaves you behind.
- **Example Activities**: 
	- “Teacher TED Talks”—staff share one new thing they learned monthly.

#### **Corruption: The Forgetting Curse**
- **Effects**: New knowledge _erases_ old. You forget last year’s curriculum.
