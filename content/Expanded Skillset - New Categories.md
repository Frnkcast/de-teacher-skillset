---

### **1. REFLEXIVE SKILLS (Self-Improvement Gone Wrong)**

#### **Mirror of Practice** 🪞 → **Narcissus’ Curse**

- **Outcome**: Burnout from over-refining, or delusion ("My teaching is flawless—the students just don’t get it").

#### **Growth Mindset** 🌱 → **Gaslight Gardener**

- **Dark Side**: Weaponizing resilience. "If you failed, you didn’t _try hard enough_." Ignores systemic barriers.
- **Outcome**: Students blame themselves for external failures (e.g., poverty, bad curriculum).

#### **Bias Check** 🧐 → **Paralysis of Guilt**

- **Dark Side**: Overcorrecting to the point of absurdity. "I can’t call on anyone because _what if I’m biased_?"

#### **Feedback Alchemy** 🔄 → **Criticism Vampirism**

- **Dark Side**: Addicted to critique. You seek out negative feedback to fuel self-flagellation.

- **Outcome**: Admin sees you as a "troublemaker," not a leader.

#### **Bureaucracy Whisperer** 📜 → **Shadow Administrator**
