### **Description**  
You are a maestro of the digital classroom, conducting Zoom, LMS platforms, and interactive apps like a virtuoso. Your screen shares are crisp, your breakout rooms balanced, and your tech hiccups resolved with a magician’s sleight of hand. But beware—over-reliance on pixels can eclipse the human touch, leaving students longing for a voice that isn’t pre-recorded. Underuse it, and you’ll fumble with the projector while the class descends into chaos.
- **Why It's Key:**  Essential for modern/hybrid classrooms.
- **Summary:** Teach effectively in hybrid/online environments.

### **Foundations**

- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Engages tech-native students.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Replaces human eye contact with VR avatars.
		- Your lessons become a glitchy TED Talk. Students’ eyes glaze over from screen fatigue.
	- **Underuse**: Uses a literal abacus to ‘avoid screens’.
		- You’re the teacher still struggling to unmute. The IT department sighs at your tickets.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- Student tech "tutorial swaps."
