### **Description**  
You are the _defender of the defenseless_—fighting for resources, policy changes, and student needs with the fervor of a revolutionary. Your words bend ears in faculty meetings; your petitions gather dust in admin offices. But beware: too much fire burns _you_ first.
- **Why It's Key:** Fights for resources/student needs.
- **Summary:** Push for resources, policy changes, or student needs.

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: 
	- **Distributed Leadership** (Spillane, 2006): Shared advocacy.
	- **Critical Pedagogy** (Freire, 1970): Education as liberation.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Drives change, builds allyship.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Storms the district office demanding gold-plated microscopes.
		- You become the _Martyr of Room 207_, sacrificing health and sanity for unwinnable battles. Colleagues whisper, _"Here comes the Complaints Department."_
	- **Underuse**: Whispers complaints to the laminator.
		- Silence is complicity. The broken system grinds on, and your students pay the price.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- Student-led petition campaigns.
	- Draft a _"Needs vs. Wants"_ proposal (e.g., _"Need: Working heat. Want: A pony."_).

#### **Alternate Skill: The Silent Strike**
- **Description**: You advocate _without speaking_—using data, student work, and strategic silence to force change.
- **Ideal For**: Introverted teachers in hostile admin environments.
- **Trade-off**: Slow but undeniable; risks being overlooked if too subtle.
#### **Corruption: The Martyr's Megaphone**
- **Effect**: You weaponize advocacy, turning every request into a _public spectacle_.
- **Cost**: Admin digs in heels; colleagues resent the drama.
- **Eldritch Sign**: Your demands echo in empty halls long after you’ve left.
#### **Critical Failure: The Broken Record** 
- **Signs**: Repeating the same ineffective arguments louder, not smarter.
- **Student Impact**: Learns helplessness ("Why bother? Nothing changes").
#### **Redemption Arc**  
- **Intervention**: 
- **Symbolic Moment**:
