### **Description**  
You are the architect of learning, crafting lesson plans that are both structured and adaptable. Your blueprints turn chaos into order, ensuring every class flows smoothly from one activity to the next. However, too much structure can stifle spontaneity, leaving no room for the magic of unplanned moments.
- **Why It's Key:** Effective lesson planning ensures that teaching is purposeful and aligned with learning goals.
- **Summary:** Designs structured yet adaptable lesson plans.

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: **Backward Design** (Wiggins & McTighe) emphasizes starting with learning outcomes and planning lessons to achieve them.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Ensures pacing, aligns objectives.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Your lesson is so rigidly planned that you can’t adapt when a student’s question derails your script.
	- **Underuse**:  Your lesson is a disjointed mess, jumping from topic to topic with no clear structure. Chaos reigns.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- Backward-design unit templates.

### **RPG Elements**  
- **Subskills:**
	- **Subskill: _Backup Blueprint_** – Improvise a lesson when tech fails.
	- **Subskill: _Pacing Divination_** – Sense when to speed up/slow down.
	- **Subskill: _Easter Egg Plans_** – Hide bonus content for curious students.
- **Abilities:**
	- **T1**: _Lesson Blueprinter_ – Crafts coherent daily plans.
	- **T2**: _Adaptive Designer_ – Improvises when lessons derail.
	- **T3**: _Grand Syllabus_ – Plans entire semesters like chess games.
	- **Eldritch**: **《The Infinite Unit》** – Your lessons loop until _perfected_.
#### **Alternate Skill: Jury-Rigger** 🛠️🎭
- **Description**: Your "lesson plans" are napkin doodles. You teach whatever the room’s vibes demand, like an academic jazz musician.
- **Ideal For**: The **Improvisational Art Teacher** whose syllabus is a suggestion box.
- **Trade-off**: Chaotic but _weirdly adaptive_. Students never know what’s next—including you.
#### **Corruption: The Lesson That Teaches Itself**
- **Effect**: Your plans **execute autonomously**. You could vanish, but Unit 3 _will_ be covered.
- **Cost**: The lesson **replaces you** with a _more efficient instructor_.
#### **Critical Failure: The Bureaucratic Lich
- **Signs**: Your lesson plans **outlive their purpose**.
    - _"We _must_ stick to the 2018 syllabus—even though the textbook burned in a fire."_
- **Student Reaction**: Rebellion via passive-aggressive sticky notes.
#### **Redemption Arc**  
- **Intervention**: 
- **Symbolic Moment**:
