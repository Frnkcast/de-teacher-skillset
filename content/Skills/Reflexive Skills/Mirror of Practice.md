### **Description**  
Your reflection is your co-teacher. You obsessively analyze your lessons, replaying each misstep and triumph like a film reel. The _Mirror_ doesn’t lie—but it can distort. Too much staring, and you’ll forget the students behind your own ghostly double. Too little, and you’ll blunder into the same disasters forever.
- **Why It's Key:** Ensures teaching evolves through self-awareness.
- **Summary:** Regularly self-evaluate lessons via recording or journals.

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: **Schön’s Reflective Practitioner** (1983): "Reflection-in-action" during teaching. **Metacognition** (Flavell, 1979): Thinking about one’s thinking.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	-  Identifies blind spots, adapts methods.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Spends 3 hours analyzing a 10-minute lesson—misses the actual class.
		- Paralysis by analysis. You tweak a single lesson plan for weeks, chasing perfection like a mad scientist. The students? They’ve moved on to the next unit without you.
	- **Underuse**: Teaches the same way since 1992, wonders why students yawn.
		- You’re a wind-up toy, repeating the same stale routine year after year. The world changes; your teaching doesn’t.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- Record a lesson, then watch it _with a colleague_. Drink every time you say “um.” (Just kidding—hydration is key.)

### **RPG Elements**  
- **Subskills:**
- **Abilities:**
#### **Alternate Skill: Echo Chamber
- **Description**: You _only_ learn from your own past lessons, creating a feedback loop of iterative self-improvement—with no external input.
- **Ideal For**: The **Hermit Teacher** who distrusts outside opinions (e.g., an eccentric veteran).
- **Trade-off**:
    - ✅ _Deeply_ refines personal style.
    - ❌ Blind to innovative methods; risks stagnation.
#### **Corruption: The Recursive Ghost**
- **Effect**: Your reflections become _sentient_. Past versions of yourself critique your teaching in real-time.
	- _"2022-You would’ve explained this better."_
- **Cost**: Paralysis by analysis; students witness you arguing with yourself.
#### **Critical Failure: Narcissus' Curse** 
- **Signs**: Obsessively films lessons, rewatching them to nitpick _your_ performance—not student learning.
- **Student Impact**:  Students feel like extras in your "teacher movie."
#### **Redemption Arc**  
- **Intervention**: 
- **Symbolic Moment**:
