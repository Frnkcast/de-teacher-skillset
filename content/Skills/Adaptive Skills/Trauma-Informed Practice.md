### **Description**  
You see the invisible wounds. A clenched jaw, a withdrawn posture—you recognize the signs of a student carrying burdens heavier than their backpack. Your classroom is a sanctuary where triggers are disarmed, and healing begins with a whispered “You’re safe here.” But tread lightly: over-pathologize every flinch, and you’ll smother growth in cotton wool. Ignore trauma entirely, and you’ll bulldoze tender hearts.

- **Strengths**:  
	- Creates safety, prevents triggers.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Interprets a yawn as repressed childhood trauma.
		- You diagnose _test anxiety_ as _childhood trauma_. Students feel like lab specimens.
	- **Underuse**: Tells a grieving kid to ‘focus on the worksheet’.
		- You dismiss a panic attack as “drama.” Trust evaporates.
- **Example Activities**:  
	- "Safe Space" sensory corners.
