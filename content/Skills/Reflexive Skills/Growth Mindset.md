### **Description**  
Failure is fertilizer—or so you preach. You see potential in every flubbed test, every crumpled draft. But beware: this isn’t toxic positivity. You can’t just slap a “Yet!” on a systemic injustice and call it growth. And if you _only_ focus on the future, you’ll trample the fragile seedlings of the present.
- **Why It's Key:** Fosters resilience in teachers and students.
- **Summary:** View failures as learning opportunities (for yourself and students).

### **Foundations**  
- **Theoretical basis**: 
	- **Dweck’s Mindset Theory** (2006): Fixed vs. growth mindsets.
	- **Vygotsky’s ZPD**: Stretching abilities through scaffolding.
- **Key Theories**: 
- **Research Link**: 

### **In Practice**  
- **Strengths**:  
	- Encourages risk-taking, normalizes mistakes.
- **Weaknesses**:  
	- **Overuse**: Celebrates a blank paper as ‘beautiful potential’. 
		- “You failed? _Good!_” (The student bursts into tears.) You’ve turned resilience into a cult, ignoring real barriers.
	- **Underuse**: Cancels lab experiments because ‘kids can’t handle failure’.
		- Fixed mindset tyranny. “Talent” is a life sentence; effort is for the deluded.
- **Example Activities**: 
	- "Yet" journals ("I can’t do this... _yet_").
	- “Failure CVs”—students list their flops and what they learned. Bonus: Do one _yourself_.

### **RPG Elements**  
- **Subskills:**
- **Abilities:**
#### **Alternate Skill: Gaslight Gardener**
- **Description**:  You "help" students reframe _all_ failures as _their_ fault. _"You didn’t fail—you just didn’t _want_ it enough."_
- **Ideal For**: The **Tough-Love Coach** (e.g., a drill sergeant-style PE teacher).
- **Trade-off**: 
	- ✅ Builds resilience in some.
	- ❌ Ignores systemic barriers (poverty, disabilities).
#### **Corruption: The Cult of Effort**
- **Effects**: Struggle becomes dogma. You punish _success_ to enforce "growth."
    - _"Your A+ proves you didn’t challenge yourself!"_
- **Cost**: Students fake incompetence to avoid backlash.
#### **Critical Failure: The Broken Record** 
- **Signs**: Repeats _"Mistakes are gifts!"_ while ignoring actual student distress.
- **Impact**: Kids hide struggles to avoid your toxic positivity.
#### **Redemption Arc**  
- **Intervention**: 
- **Symbolic Moment**:
