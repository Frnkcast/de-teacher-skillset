## **Skillset**

1. [[Atlas of Knowledge]] 🧠🌍 (Mastery of curriculum)
	- *Description:* Your mind is a vast repository of information, a living encyclopedia of your subject. You can recall facts, theories, and debates with ease, weaving them into lessons that captivate and educate. However, knowledge alone isn’t enough—you must also know how to share it in a way that resonates with your students. Without this skill, you risk losing your way in the material, leaving students adrift. But wield it with care—drowning students in minutiae can turn even the most fascinating topic into a snooze fest.
	- _Theoretical Basis:_ **Bloom’s Taxonomy** emphasizes the importance of mastery and application of knowledge. Teachers must have a deep understanding of their subject to guide students through higher-order thinking.
    - _Why It’s Key:_ A teacher’s expertise directly impacts their ability to inspire confidence and curiosity in students.
    - _Lack:_ You misquote a basic fact, and the class erupts in laughter. Your credibility crumbles like a stale biscuit.
    - _Excess:_ You drown students in minutiae, turning every lesson into a lecture on obscure trivia. Their eyes glaze over.
	
2. [[Logicweave]] 🧵➗ (Breaking down complex concepts):  
	- *Description:* You are a master of reason, untangling complex ideas and presenting them in clear, logical steps. Your explanations are like bridges, guiding students from confusion to understanding. Yet, logic can be a double-edged sword—over-reliance on it can make your teaching feel cold and mechanical, leaving no room for creativity or intuition.
    - _Theoretical Basis:_ **Constructivist Learning Theory** (Piaget, Vygotsky) highlights the importance of scaffolding—breaking down complex ideas into manageable steps.
    - _Why It’s Key:_ Teachers must adapt their explanations to meet students’ varying levels of understanding.
    - _Lack:_ You accept a student’s flawed argument without question, leaving the class confused and misinformed.
    - _Excess:_ You dissect every idea to the point of paralysis, leaving no room for creativity or intuition.

3. [[Planwright]] 📜✏️(Lesson design):   
    - *Description:* You are the architect of learning, crafting lesson plans that are both structured and adaptable. Your blueprints turn chaos into order, ensuring every class flows smoothly from one activity to the next. However, too much structure can stifle spontaneity, leaving no room for the magic of unplanned moments.
    - _Theoretical Basis:_ **Backward Design** (Wiggins & McTighe) emphasizes starting with learning outcomes and planning lessons to achieve them.
    - _Why It’s Key:_ Effective lesson planning ensures that teaching is purposeful and aligned with learning goals.
    - _Lack:_ Your lesson is a disjointed mess, jumping from topic to topic with no clear structure. Chaos reigns.
    - _Excess:_ Your lesson is so rigidly planned that you can’t adapt when a student’s question derails your script.
    
4. [[Truthseeker]] 🔍✨ (Diagnosing student struggles):
    - *Description:* You are a detective in the classroom, uncovering the hidden struggles and misunderstandings that hold students back. Your insight helps you tailor your teaching to meet their needs, turning obstacles into opportunities. But be cautious—misreading a student’s confusion as disinterest can leave them feeling unseen and unsupported.
    - _Theoretical Basis:_ **Differentiated Instruction** (Tomlinson) stresses the need to identify and address individual student needs.
    - _Why It’s Key:_ Teachers must be able to recognize and respond to learning barriers.
    - _Lack:_ Your lens is fogged, missing key details that might recognized a student's cry for help and they end up flunking the course.
    - _Excess:_ You peer through the lens so intently that you see problems where there are none, making students feel self-concious and overanalyzed.
    
5. [[Rulebender]] 📏🔄 (Navigating policies creatively)
    - *Description:* You are a creative navigator of policies, finding ways to work within—or around—the rules to benefit your students. Your flexibility fosters innovation, but it can also land you in hot water if you push too far. Striking the right balance is key.
    - _Theoretical Basis:_ **Distributed Leadership** (Spillane) suggests that teachers often need to adapt policies to fit their classroom context.
    - _Why It’s Key:_ Flexibility within constraints is essential for innovation in teaching.
    - _Lack:_ You violate a key school policy, landing yourself in a meeting with the principal and a mountain of paperwork.
    - _Excess:_ You become so obsessed with following every rule that you stifle creativity and innovation in your teaching.
    
6. [[Wisdomkeeper]] 📖🕯️ (Mentorship):
	- *Description:* You are a guardian of knowledge and experience, sharing your hard-earned wisdom with colleagues and students alike. Your guidance helps others grow, but be mindful—offering advice without empathy can come off as condescending.

    - _Why It’s Key:_ Experienced teachers play a crucial role in guiding and supporting their peers.
    - _Lack:_ A new teacher flounders because you didn’t offer guidance, leaving them to sink or swim.
