---

### **1. REFLEXIVE SKILLS (Self-Improvement Gone Wrong)**

#### **Growth Mindset** 🌱 → **Gaslight Gardener**

- **Dark Side**: Weaponizing resilience. "If you failed, you didn’t _try hard enough_." Ignores systemic barriers.
- **Outcome**: Students blame themselves for external failures (e.g., poverty, bad curriculum).

#### **Bias Check** 🧐 → **Paralysis of Guilt**
