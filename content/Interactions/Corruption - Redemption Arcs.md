### **Redemption Arcs for Corrupted Teacher Skills**

_(How to rehabilitate teachers who’ve gone off the deep end with their skills—without losing what made them effective in the first place.)_

---

#### **1. THE PEDANT’S CURSE (Atlas of Knowledge)**

**Corruption**: Obsessed with trivia, drowning students in minutiae.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Encyclopedic Overload to Curated Wisdom_
- **Intervention**: Student-led "relevance checks" – _"Why does this detail matter?"_
- **Goal**: Shift from _knowing everything_ to _teaching what’s meaningful_.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Donates their 50-pound binder of "fun facts" to the library.

---

#### **2. THE CULT LEADER (Wonderkindler)**

**Corruption**: Inspiration as indoctrination; suppresses dissent.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Prophet to Guide_
- **Intervention**: Assign a _devil’s advocate_ student to challenge ideas respectfully.
- **Goal**: Replace _"Believe!"_ with _"Question!"_
- **Symbolic Moment**: Leads a Socratic seminar where _no one agrees with them_.

---

#### **3. THE BUREAUCRATIC LICH (Planwright)**

**Corruption**: Slave to outdated plans; no adaptability.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Undead Archivist to Living Architect_
- **Intervention**: "Plan Wrecking Ball" – Students _rip up_ one rigid rule per week.
- **Goal**: Learn to scribble in the margins of lesson plans.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Tears up their pristine 2018 syllabus mid-lesson.

---
#### **4. THE EMOTIONAL VAMPIRE (Heartstring)**

**Corruption**: Feeds on student trauma for "connection."  
**Redemption Path**: _From Drain to Reservoir_
- **Intervention**: "No Trauma Tuesdays" – Only academic discussions.
- **Goal**: Build trust _without_ oversharing or probing.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Says _"I don’t need to know why you’re sad—just how I can help."_

---

#### **5. THE GLITCH PROPHET (Technomancer’s Touch)**
**Corruption**: Worships broken tech; resists upgrades.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Techno-Mystic to Digital Mentor_
- **Intervention**: Student "tech interns" teach _them_ one new tool monthly.
- **Goal**: Use tech to _serve_ learning, not vice versa.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Retires the sacred, flickering projector.

---

#### **6. THE ANARCH’S NIGHTMARE (Rulebender)**
**Corruption**: Chaos agent; no rules survive them.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Rebel to Revolutionary_
- **Intervention**: Co-write classroom policies _with students_.
- **Goal**: Channel creativity into _better_ systems, not destruction.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Enforces a rule _they_ invented.

---

#### **7. THE CAFFEINE GOLEM (Metabolic Dynamo)**
**Corruption**: Runs on espresso and existential dread.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Machine to Human_
- **Intervention**: "Hydration Buddy" – A student reminds them to drink water.
- **Goal**: Model _sustainable_ energy, not martyrdom.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Takes a sick day _before_ collapsing.

---

#### **8. THE GOSSIP HYDRA (Web of Connections)**
**Corruption**: Spreads rumors like pollen.  
**Redemption Path**: _From Poison to Pollinator_
- **Intervention**: "Rumor to Resource" – Redirect gossip into _advocacy_.
- **Goal**: Use networks for _solutions_, not drama.
- **Symbolic Moment**: Exposes a _real_ issue (e.g., broken AC) via their grapevine.

---

### **Redemption Mechanics**

1. **Atonement Task**: A concrete action to break the corruption (e.g., _Cult Leader_ must confess they’ve been wrong).
2. **Student Role**: Learners help "rehabilitate" the teacher (adds buy-in).
3. **Relapse Risks**: Under stress, old habits resurface (_"Just one more footnote..."_).

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Narrative Satisfaction**: Teachers aren’t villains—they’re _flawed experts_.
- **Pedagogical Truth**: Growth isn’t about abandoning skills, but _rebalancing_ them.
- **Student Agency**: Kids become _active participants_ in their teacher’s growth.
